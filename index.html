            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Hi, I'm Betty Pauley.</strong> I’ve always enjoyed trying
              new things and learning a variety of different skills, so although
              my background is mainly in Beauty and Writing, tech has always
              been something I’ve loved. After taking advantage of the Developer
              and Ux/UI courses on Skillcrush, I’ve only become a more
              confident, more determined and more excited person when it comes
              to being in this new world of technology. I’m a fast and
              enthusiastic learner that works great in a team and independently
              and I can’t wait to further improve my skills. I also enjoy
              creating digital art and dabble in animation, but when I’m not
              doing tech-related things, I also enjoy reading or bingeing my
              favorite movies with a nice warm cup of tea.
